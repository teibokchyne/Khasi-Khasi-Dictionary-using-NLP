in bringing out tliis little book before the public i beg to say that i have engaged in a work so ardaous that i cannot profess to have successfully completed it but encouraged by the remem brance that not a few persons have undertaken work of a similar kind in other languages on a small scale at first i did not shrink from making a like attempt myself when the work had beou finished and part of it gone through the press sir bampfyldd fuller kindly took notice of it and at his instance a coni mittee composed of dohory eopmay hajom kissoi singh and myself as members was appointed for revising and enlarging it
as the cherra dialect has been selected and introduced by the welsh missionaries and very wisely too as a standard of the khasi language no attempt has been made to insert words of other dialects excepting in a very few instances
no pains have been spared to consult as many of the bnoks and local newspapers available as have been published up to date
i have great pleasure in acknowledging my personal obliga tions to the eev j g evans to major e r w c carroll i ms and to major p r t gurdon ia for the kind and valuable assistance rendered by them i must not omit to men tion here my obligations to the members of the revising commit teeu dohory ropmay and hajom kissor singh vho have devoted much time and thought to the revision work and to some of my khasi friends from whom i derived assistance
in conclusion i beg to say that with all that i and tlse members of the committee have done there will still be room for further improvements as years pass i am however satisfied that a foundation has been laid for any improvements that may be made in future
