In bringing out tliis little
book before
the
public,
beg to
say that I have engaged in a work so ardaous that I cannot profess
to have successfully completed
it,
but, encouraged by the remem-
brance that not a few persons have undertaken work of a
similar
kind in other languages on a small scale at first, I did
not shrink
from making a like attempt myself.
When the work
had beou
finished, and part of
gone
through the
press, Sir Bampfyldd
Fuller kindly took
notice
it,
and
his
instance
coni-
mittee, composed of U Dohory
E-opmay,
b,a., U Hajom
Kissoi*
Singh, and myself, as members,
was
appointed for
revising
and
enlarging it.
As the Cherra dialect has been selected and introduced by the
"Welsh Missionaries (and very wisely
too) as
standard
the
Khasi language, no attempt has been made
insert
words
other dialects, excepting in a very few instances.
No pains have been spared to consult as many
the
bnoks
and
local
newspapers
available,
as have
been
published
to date.
I have great pleasure in acknowledging my
personal
obliga-
tions
the
Eev.
Evans, to Major E. R. W, C. Carroll,
I. M.S.,
and to Major P. R. T. Gurdon,
i.a.,
for
the
kind
and
valuable assistance rendered
by them.
I must not omit to men-
tion here my obligations to the
members of the revising commit-
tee—U Dohory Ropmay, b.a., and U Hajom Kissor
Singh ~-^vho
have devoted much time and
thought to the revision
work,
and
to some
of my Khasi friends from whom I derived assistance.
In conclusion, I beg to say
that,
with
all
that
I and
tlse.
members
the
committee
have done, there will
still
be room
for further improvements as years pass.
I am, however,
satisfied
that a foundation
has
been laid for any improvements that may
be made in future.
